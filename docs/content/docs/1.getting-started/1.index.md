Nuxt Scripts loads third-party scripts with better performance, privacy and DX in Nuxt Apps.

## Background

- Creating and using Third-Party Scripts in Nuxt should be easy and straightforward.
- Third-Party Scripts should be loaded in a way that is performant and respects user privacy.

### How Third Parties Can Impact User Experience

Third parties are external resources included, but not directly controlled, by a site owner to add new functionality to a website. Popular examples of third parties include analytics, video embeds, maps, and social media integrations. Typically, third-party providers offer code snippets that can be added to the `head` or `body` section of the document.

Adding a single third-party resource to your Nuxt application might not have any noticeable impact on performance, but it can quickly begin to affect user experience if youâ€™re not careful. Many third parties, especially scripts, can take a relatively long time to download and execute, which can delay user interactivity and block page rendering.

Data from the Chrome User Experience Report shows that Nuxt sites that load more third-party resources have lower [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/articles/inp) (INP) and [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/lcp) (LCP) pass rates.

While the chart's correlation does not automatically indicate causation, lab experiments and data from the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/third-parties) provide further evidence that third-party resources significantly affect page performance.
