## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to load the [js-confetti](https://github.com/loonywizard/js-confetti) script using the Nuxt Scripts module.

You'll learn about the following: 
- What the `useScriptNpm` registry script is.
- How to load the `js-confetti` script using it.
- Adding types to loaded scripts.
- Using proxied functions to call the script.

## Background on useScriptNpm

To load the script, we'll be using the [useScriptNpm](/api/use-script). 

This is a [registry script](/scripts), a supported
third-party integration build on top of the
[useScript](/api/use-script) composable that allows you to load scripts from NPM.

When working with NPM files, you'd typically include them as a node_module dependency in the `package.json` file. However,
optimizing the script loading of these scripts can be difficult, requiring a dynamic import of the module from a separate chunk and
loading it only when needed. It also slows down your build as the module needs to be transpiled.

The `useScriptNpm` registry script abstracts this process, allowing you to load the script with a single line of code. In many instances
it will still make more sense to include the script as a dependency in the `package.json` file, but for scripts that are not used often or
are not critical to the application, this is a great alternative.

To begin with we can think of using this script as an alternative to the `useHead` composable. You can see an example of the abstraction 
layers in the following code sample.

::code-group

```ts [Registry Script useScriptNpm]
useScriptNpm({
  src: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
})
```

```ts [useScript]
useScript('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@latest/dist/js-confetti.browser.js')
```

```ts [useHead]
useHead({
  scripts: [
    { src: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-confetti@latest/dist/js-confetti.browser.js' }
  ]
})
```

### Loading the script

Within your one of your components, you'll want to load the script. You can do this by using the `useScriptNpm` registry script.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
})
</script>
```

If you check your browser requests, you should see the script being loaded.

### Using the script

Now that the script is loaded, you can use it in your component. The script will be loaded asynchronously, so you'll either need to wait for it to be loaded 
or make use of the proxied functions that are returned from the `useScriptNpm` composable.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
})
// using the proxied function API
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

Congrats! You should see some emojis once the script is loaded in.

However, you'll notice that we have an issue with types here. The `addConfetti` function is not typed, so we don't get any intellisense or type checking.

### Adding types

To add types to the script, you can create a new file in the `types` directory of your project.

```ts [global.d.ts]
export interface JSConfettiApi {
  addConfetti: (options?: { emojis: string[] }) => void
}

declare global {
  interface Window {
    JSConfetti: { new (): JSConfettiApi }
  }
}
```


```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
})
// types magically work
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

## Understanding proxied functions

The `useScriptNpm` composable will only load the script on the client side. This is because the script is not needed on the server side, and loading it there would be a waste of resources.

You may assume then ask how `addConfetti` function should work if the script isn't available. 

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
})
// what happens her when SSR or when the script is loading?
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

This is where the magic of the `useScript` composable comes in. The `addConfetti` function call is a proxy that queues the function to be called when the script is loaded. If
the script never loads then the function is never called.

On server-side when called it will therefore be a no-op. This means that you can safely call the function without worrying about the script not being loaded.

To see this in action you can set a timeout trigger.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  scriptOptions: {
    trigger: new Promise<void>(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
  }
})
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

You should see the confetti after 3 seconds.

### Bundling the script

As the script is from NPM and versioned, we can safely bundle it with our application. This will reduce the number of DNS requests needed, improving the performance of our application.

To bundle the script, you can use the `bundle` option.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  scriptOptions: {
    bundle: true
  }
})
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

You should see the script loaded in from your apps server.
