title: Script Loading Concepts
---

There are three different ways to load scripts with Nuxt Scripts:

1. [useScript](/api/use-script)
2. [Registry Scripts](/scripts)
3. [Global Scripts](/guides/globals)

Under the hood, all of these use the same `useScript` composable, but they provide different levels of abstraction and convenience.

For this reason, it's important to understand how `useScript` fundamentally works.

## How useScript works

- deduping
- defaults

## Understanding proxied functions

The `useScriptNpm` composable will only load the script on the client side. This is because the script is not needed on the server side, and loading it there would be a waste of resources.

You may assume then ask how `addConfetti` function should work if the script isn't available.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
})
// what happens her when SSR or when the script is loading?
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

This is where the magic of the `useScript` composable comes in. The `addConfetti` function call is a proxy that queues the function to be called when the script is loaded. If
the script never loads then the function is never called.

On server-side when called it will therefore be a no-op. This means that you can safely call the function without worrying about the script not being loaded.

To see this in action you can set a timeout trigger.

```vue [app.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { addConfetti } = useScriptNpm<JSConfettiApi>({
  packageName: 'js-confetti',
  file: 'dist/js-confetti.browser.js',
  scriptOptions: {
    trigger: new Promise<void>(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000))
  }
})
addConfetti({ emojis: ['🌈', '⚡️', '💥', '✨', '💫', '🌸'] })
</script>
```

You should see the confetti after 3 seconds.
