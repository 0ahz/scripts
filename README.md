# Nuxt Scripts, Assets and Third Parties

Work in progress for the development of the following modules
- Nuxt Assets - Improved loading options for assets (proxy, inline, etc)
- Nuxt Third Parties - Simple optimised wrappers for third parties

# Nuxt Scripts

Nuxt Scripts, for now is a simple composable - `useScript`.

## Features

- ü™Ñ Safely use third-party scripts before they're loaded or if they fail
- ü™ù Trigger scripts when _you_ need them (`idle`, `manual`)
- üíé Load scripts from SSR or CSR with consistent events (`load`, `error`)
- üåê Serve scripts from your domain using asset strategies (`inline`, `proxy`)

## Future Features (ideas welcome)

- üîí Lock down your site with Content Security Policy integration
- Load scripts from nuxt.config with `scripts.globals`
- ?? (ideas welcome)


## useScript

The `useScript` composable is designed for
using non-bundled IIFE scripts that have an API that you want to use in your app. It guarantees SSR support for loading and 
error events, and provides a simple API for using the script.

For example, Google Analytics, Stripe, etc.

### Simple Usage

To use external API functions before the script has loaded, there are three required options:
- `key` - A unique key for the script
- `script` - The script options, this is the same as the `script` option for `useHead`
- `use` - A function that resolves the scripts API

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
import { useScript } from '#imports'

const script = useScript({
  key: 'google-analytics',
  script: {
    src: 'https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js',
  },
  use: () => window.gtag
})
</script>
```

### Options

#### `key`

- Type: `string`
- Required: `true`

A unique key for the script

#### `script`

- Type: `ScriptOptions`
- Required: `true`
- Default: `{}`

The script options, this is the same as the `script` option for `useHead`

#### `use`

- Type: `() => any`
- Required: `true`

A function that resolves the scripts API. This is only called client-side.

#### `loadingStrategy`

- Type: `idle | Promise`
- Required: `false`

The loading strategy for the script. Can be one of the following:
- `idle` - Load the script when the browser is idle
- `Promise` - Load the script when the promise resolves

#### `assetStrategy`

- Type: `inline | proxy`
- Required: `false`

The asset strategy for the script. Can be one of the following:
- `inline` - Inline the script
- `proxy` - Proxy the script'

### Script Instance API

#### `waitForLoad`

- Type: `() => Promise<void>`

Returns a promise that resolves when the script has loaded.

```ts
const { waitForLoad, use } = useScript({
  // ...
})
// Note: for server-side, this will never resolved 
waitForLoad().then(() => {
  use().myFunction() // api is available
})
```

#### `use`

- Type: `() => any`

Returns the API of the script. This is only available after the script has loaded.

```ts
const { use } = useScript({
  // ...
})
use() // most likely undefined
```

#### status

- Type: `Ref<ScriptStatus>`

The status of the script. Can be one of the following: `'awaitingLoad' | 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error'`

# Nuxt Third Parties

## Scripts

A thin wrapper around third-party scripts providing optimised loading, SSR support and a proxied API.

Requires `@nuxt/scripts`.

### Global Scripts

Load scripts in globally from nuxt.config, tree-shakes them appropriately depending on build

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  scripts: {
    globals: {
      googleAnalytics: {
        id: 'UA-XXXXXX-X'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Use the API within your app without needing to provide the id or triggering a reload.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
function someEvent() {
  const { gtag } = useGoogleAnalytics()
  gtag('event', 'some_event')
}
</script>
```

### On Demand Scripts

Load scripts on demand from within your app.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
const { $script, gtag } = useGoogleAnalytics({
  id: 'UA-XXXXXX-X',
  // can use any of the load strategies
  loadingStrategy: 'idle'
})
// we can start using gtag before the script has loaded, it will be queued and sent once the script has loaded
gtag('pageview', '/some/page')
$script.waitForLoad().then(() => {
  console.log('Google Analytics loaded', window.gtag)
})
</script>
```

They can be used from separate components and will be deduped.

```vue
<script lang="ts" setup>
// doesn't need an id as it's already been registered
const { gtag } = useGoogleAnalytics()
function someEvent() {
  gtag('event', 'some_event')
}
</script>
```

### Proxied API

- Function calls in unsupported environments (server side)
- Queued function calls for when the script has loaded (i.e send analytic events once a consent is agreed)
- Use functions when browser extensions may have blocked the library
